# 3. Dependencies
## 3.1 Overview
<ul>
    <li>C++17</li>
    <li>OpenCV-4.5.0</li>
    <li>Eigen-3.3</li>
    <li>Open3D-0.18.0</li>
    <li>Pangolin-0.9</li>
    <li>Suitsparse</li>
</ul>

## 3.2 Pangolin
We use [Pangolin 0.9](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## 3.3 OpenCV
We use [OpenCV 4.5.0](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and track the features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org.

## 3.4 Eigen3
We use Eigen 3.3 to make the code more readable. Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org.

## 3.5 Open3D
We use [Open3D 0.18.0](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D) for loading pointclouds, meshes and to compare the result with ground truth. Download and install instructions can be found at: https://www.open3d.org/

## 3.6 Suitsparse
We use the Suitsparse library for the optimization process.

# 4. Installation and Building
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DominikSlomma/Efficient-and-Accurate-Template-based-Reconstruction-of-Deformable-Surfaces
```
We provide a script `build.sh`to build *Efficient-and-Accurate-Template-based-Reconstruction-of-Deformable-Surfaces*.
Please make sure that all dependencies are installed (see section 3).
```
cd Efficient-and-Accurate-Template-based-Reconstruction-of-Deformable-Surfaces
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
This will create a folder *build* where the executables will be created.

# 5. Datasets
You can download our dataset over the following link: [our dataset](https://studentutsedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dominik_slomma_student_uts_edu_au/En2xaoWUZQVGmsBuW14nYD4BOoOHps-iM8LH1pO6xcsj0Q?e=8nT7iQ)

If you want the original blanket dataset please refere to the  [$\phi$-SfT](https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/phi-SfT/) project website.

If you are interest on your own colonoscopy dataset use the folloging github: [Colonoscopy simulator](https://github.com/zsustc/colon_reconstruction_dataset) 

If you want to have the original Phantom dataset please refer to the [Hamlyn-Website](https://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/vision/)



# 6. Run
The executable files are created in the *build* folder. To be able to execute these executable files successfully, first switch to the *build* folder and execute the corresponding program. To be able to run the program successfully, please adjust the corresponding configuration file in the *App* folder. 

If you want to use the current configuration, please create a *data* folder and include *our* dataset. Also change into the *build* folder:

```
cd ./build/
```
After that you can run one out of 14 tests. The appications are shown below:

Blanket-Dataset:
```
./S1_real
./S2_real
./S3_real
./S4_real
./S5_real
./S6_real
./S7_real
./S8_real
./S9_real
```
Colonoscopy-Dataset:
```
./colonscopy_1
./colonscopy_2
./colonscopy_3
```
Hamlyn-Dataset:
```
./hamlyn_f5
./hamlyn_f7
```
